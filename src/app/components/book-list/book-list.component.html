          The first book for the kids book debate club is
          <strong>Mike Mulligan and his Steam Shovel</strong>. You can watch
          someone read the book out loud (with the illustrations!) below.
        </p>
        <p>We will be debating whether X or Y.</p>
        <p>
          You can come into the debate with a side picked, or start out neutral.
          Both sides will have a captain who will make a presentation for their
          side. During the debate everyone but the captain can switch sides.
          Whichever side has most people at the end wins!
        </p>
        <p>This books debate will be on X.</p>
